# BikeSharing
Regression analysis to predict bike sharing rides using both Machine Learning algorithms and Neural Networks

BikeSharing is the first project in the Deep Learning Nanodegree program at Udacity. <br>
The project objective is to use a simple neural network to predict the number of bike rides from historical data.<br>
Aditionally, I also used several machine learning algorithmns to compare their results against the neural network.<br>

Data files are in the folder Bike-Sharing-Dataset.
Bike_Sharing_ML.ipynb is the Python3 jupyter notebook. It requires libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and sklearn libraries: mean_squared_error, GridSearchCV, linear_model, neighbors, ensemble, svm, and xgboost.

* The ensemble method ExtraTreesRegressor demonstrated the best validation loss among the sklearn algorithms.
